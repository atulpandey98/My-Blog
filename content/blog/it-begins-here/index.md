## My Intro

I am a Final year Btech. Student.

Currently, I am going through a phase of learning and trying lots of different stuff.

Earlier, I used to think that, "Ooooh I don't like drawing and shit so I won't do front end and no web development. I would only make softwares and do the backend".

But as you mature your thought process changes. That's exactly happened to me. (All thanks to Tanay Pratap sir. Do check his [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanaypratap/).

So now I am learning web development from the beginning. Made my portfolio with Html, css and basic js only, no library or frameworks.

##Techie techie things

I code in Java. Did all of my competitive programmings in Java;

Also know a few other languages like c, c++, python. Recently, I made a Linkedin web scraper;

Check that out on my Github. [Here](https://github.com/atulpandey98/LinkedIn-Post-Scraper);

Now I am learning web development;

Next, I will learn MERN stack and build some projects around them;

##Not techie techie things.

I did dancing as a hobby.

I learnt the guitar. (This is love).

I learnt 1 song on the flute. (This is tough).

Currently learning keyboard. (This is easy).

That's all about me.
